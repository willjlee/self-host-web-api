----

Add self-host package via the package manager.

Can use the api stuff  in a console application (as done in this tutorial).

Client side, it is nearly identical to the previous api client project.

If using a package already installed by the package manager and it isn't being recognized, find it in the manager and hit manage, then select the current project.

--

The server and client can be run in the same project, and even in the same file, as shown in the sample project.
